Simply awesome project management in Atom.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mehcode/atom-project-plus/master/project-plus.gif)

 - **No configuration** — atom was already keeping track of your projects

 - **No mess** (project files) — atom already knows about your projects and their needs (and is planning to know more)

 - **No weirdness** — switching between projects (in the same window) is done correctly and does not corrupt state (unlike every existing project package I've seen)

 - Fully supports projects with multiple paths

## Installation

```
apm install project-plus
```

## Usage

#### Project Finder

 - `ctrl-alt-p` (linux/windows) or `ctrl-cmd-p` (mac) to open the project finder
 - `enter` will open the project in the current window by default[*](#open-in-new-window)
 - `shift-enter` will open the project in a new window by default[*](#open-in-new-window)

#### Project Tab

 - `ctrl-cmd-tab` will switch to the next recently used project
 - `ctrl-shift-cmd-tab` will switch to the previous recently used project

## Commands

#### Project Plus: Open

Switch to a project (in the current atom window by default[*](#open-in-new-window)) by selecting one or more
folders using an OS folder picker.

#### Project Plus: Close

Close the current project and revert to an empty atom window.

#### Project Plus: Save

Saves the current project and marks it to be shown in the project finder (
if not using auto-discover).

#### Project Plus: Remove

Remove a project from the session storage and from the `projects.cson`.

#### Project Plus: Edit Projects

Opens the `projects.cson` file. This file can be populated either manually or
via saving projects with `project-plus:save`.

## Configuration

#### Auto Discover

Disable to limit the project finder to explicitly saved projects (
managed through `projects.cson` in the Atom configuration directory).

#### Project Home

Specify a folder or glob pattern to limit projects that are discovered. This is
a case-sensitive field, make sure you've got the path name specified correctly.
Any saved projects that aren't in your project home will still be displayed.

#### Show Project Path

Disable to hide the project paths.

#### Open in New Window

Open projects in a new window by default. `shift-enter` will always do the inverse.
